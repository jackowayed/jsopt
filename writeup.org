* Overview
For our project, we created a tool for Javascript authors.  Since
modern web applications make heavy ues of Javascript for basic
functionality, modern web browsers contain very fancy Javascript
engines designed to maximize performance. Engines JIT Javascript code
to native code and also dynamically optimize the machine code.

However, due to the loose and freewheeling nature of Javascript, many
common Javascript programming paradigms create optimization barriers.
For instance, in Google's V8 engine, Javascript objects are compiled
to C++ classes to allow very quick access to object fields. This is
much faster than using a hashtable to resolve field names to locations
in memory.  Hoewver, whenever a Javascript author adds a new field to
an existing object, V8 must create a new C++ class, as C++ classes
cannot be changed like a hashtable can be.

As another example, V8 attempts to inline function calls, but won't 
inline if the target fuction is too large. However, V8
